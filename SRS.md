## **8. System Architecture**

The system architecture for the **QuickKart** platform is designed to ensure scalability, maintainability, and efficiency. The architecture is divided into **frontend**, **backend**, **database**, and **payment gateway** components, each with a specific role.

### **1. Frontend**
- **Technologies**: 
  - **Web Application**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and **React.js** for building an interactive, dynamic, and responsive user interface.  
  - **Mobile Application**: **React Native** is used to create a cross-platform mobile app that works on both Android and iOS.  
- **Role**:  
  - Handles user interactions such as browsing products, adding them to the cart, and managing user accounts.  
  - Provides a smooth and intuitive user experience with responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.  
  - Communicates with the backend via **REST APIs** to retrieve or send data (e.g., user login, product details, or order placement).  

---

### **2. Backend**
- **Technologies**: **Node.js** (runtime), **Express.js** (web framework)  
- **Role**:  
  - Acts as the central control unit that processes user requests, manages business logic, and communicates with the database.  
  - Exposes **REST APIs** that facilitate data flow between the frontend and backend.  
  - Handles crucial operations like user authentication, product listings, inventory management, order processing, and notifications.  
  - Integrates with third-party services, including payment gateways and notification services.  

---

### **3. Database**
- **Technology**: **MySQL** (Relational Database)  
- **Role**:  
  - Stores and manages all platform data, including:  
    - **User Data**: Usernames, passwords, shipping addresses, payment preferences, etc.  
    - **Product Data**: Product details (name, description, images, price, stock availability, SKUs, categories).  
    - **Order Data**: Order history, payment status, shipping details, and transaction logs.  
    - **Seller Data**: Details related to sellers, their product listings, and order details.  
  - Ensures **data integrity and consistency** across all system modules.  
  - Supports efficient **query optimization** to ensure fast data retrieval, especially during searches and order tracking.  

---

### **4. Payment Gateway**
- **Technologies**: **Stripe**, **PayPal**, and **UPI** (Unified Payments Interface)  
- **Role**:  
  - Manages secure payment processing by facilitating payments from users to sellers.  
  - Supports multiple payment methods such as credit/debit cards, UPI, PayPal, and digital wallets.  
  - Ensures that all payment data is encrypted during transmission using **TLS/SSL** protocols to prevent unauthorized access.  
  - Adheres to **PCI-DSS** (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards) to ensure the security of payment transactions.  

---

### **System Flow (Simplified)**
1. **User Interaction**: A user browses the frontend (web or mobile) and selects products to purchase.  
2. **API Request**: The frontend sends a request to the backend via **REST APIs**.  
3. **Backend Processing**: The backend processes the request, interacts with the database (MySQL) to retrieve or update product, user, or order information.  
4. **Response to Frontend**: The backend returns the requested data (e.g., product details, cart updates) to the frontend.  
5. **Payment Gateway**: When users check out, payment details are sent to **Stripe/PayPal/UPI** via secure payment APIs, and the status of the payment is updated in the database.  
6. **Order Confirmation**: Once the payment is successful, an order is created, and the order details are stored in the MySQL database. Notifications are sent to the user and seller about the order status.  

This architecture ensures a **seamless shopping experience**, supports **real-time order tracking**, and enables the platform to handle high traffic during peak sales events.
