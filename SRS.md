### Appendix B: Assumptions and Dependencies

# System Architecture

The architecture of the Flipkart Clone application consists of the following key components:

1. *Frontend*: This component handles user interactions, including browsing products, managing the shopping cart, checking out, and tracking orders. The frontend will be built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React (for the web app), or React Native (for mobile app development).

2. *Backend*: The backend handles content management (product listings, user profiles, order details), API processing, and user session management. It will be built using Node.js with Express for the server-side logic, and will integrate with third-party services like payment gateways.

3. *Database*: A relational database (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL) will store user data, product information, orders, and transactional records. The database will also manage user authentication and inventory management.

4. *Payment Gateway*: The backend will integrate with payment gateways such as PayPal, Stripe, or UPI for processing secure transactions.
